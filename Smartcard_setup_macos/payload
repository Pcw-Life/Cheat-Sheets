Properties
allowSmartCard
boolean

If false, disables the SmartCard for logins, authorizations, and screen saver unlocking. It is still allowed for other functions, such as signing emails and accessing the web. A restart is required for a setting change to take effect.
Default: true
checkCertificateTrust
integer

Valid values are 0 to 3:

0: Turns off certificate trust check.

1: Turns on certificate trust check. A standard validity check is performed but doesn't include additional revocation checks.

2: Turns on certificate trust check. A soft revocation check is also performed. Until the certificate is explicitly rejected by CRL/OCSP, it's considered valid. This setting means that unavailable or unreachable CRL/OCSP allow this check to succeed.

3: Turns on certificate trust check. A hard revocation check is also performed. Unless CRL/OCSP explicitly says "This certificate is OK," it's considered invalid. This option is the most secure.
Default: 0
Possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3
enforceSmartCard
boolean

If true, a user can only log in or authenticate with a SmartCard. Available in macOS 10.13.2 and later.
Default: false
oneCardPerUser
boolean

If true, a user can pair with only one SmartCard, although existing pairings are allowed if already set up.
Default: false
tokenRemovalAction
integer

If 1, enables the screen saver when the SmartCard is removed. Available in macOS 10.13.4 and later.
Default: 0
Possible values: 0, 1
UserPairing
boolean

If false, users don't get the pairing dialog, although existing pairings still work.
Default: true
